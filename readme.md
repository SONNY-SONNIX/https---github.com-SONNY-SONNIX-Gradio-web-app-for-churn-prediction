##  Description

# Building a gradio web app for Churn Prediction at Vodafone.

This project aims to predict customer churn for Vodafone Group, a telecom company, using logistic regression and create an interactive web application using Gradio. The churn prediction model is built based on customer attributes provided in the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

SeniorCitizen
Partner
Dependents
Tenure
InternetService
OnlineSecurity
OnlineBackup
DeviceProtection
TechSupport
StreamingTV
StreamingMovies
Contract
PaperlessBilling
PaymentMethod
MonthlyCharges
TotalCharges

# Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Copy code

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory.

Copy code

cd <project-directory>
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Copy code

python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment.

On Windows:

Copy code

myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

Copy code

source myenv/bin/activate
Install the required packages.

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage 

Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Train the logistic regression model on the preprocessed dataset.

Run the Gradio web app using python app.py.

Access the web application through the provided URL.

Enter customer details in the web app interface to obtain churn predictions based on the trained model.
